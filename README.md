I made a STM Cube IDE Project with a Setup that uses the external SDRAM via FMC for the Framebuffer and the LCD initialization via SPI5 for the RGB Interface of the builtin ILI9341 Dispalycontroller. The Display is controlled with the LTDC.
I use max. Clockspeed 180Mhz and make the whole Project Quick and Dirty. There are many Codeartefacts that can be removed.

The uploaded Project is exportet as a Archive File .zip you can import it without any changes in the STM Cude IDE (my Cube IDE Rev. 1.18.1)
